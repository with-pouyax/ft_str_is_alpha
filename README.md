# ft_str_is_alpha

The `ft_str_is_alpha` function is a custom utility designed to assess the alphabetic content of strings in C programming. It evaluates whether a given string consists exclusively of alphabetic characters, making it a valuable tool for validating input data, parsing text, or performing any operation where string content needs to be strictly alphabetic.

## Description

This function takes a single argument: a pointer to a character string. It iterates through the string, examining each character to determine if it falls within the alphabetic range (`'a'` to `'z'` or `'A'` to `'Z'`). The function returns `1` (true) if the entire string is alphabetic, and `0` (false) otherwise.
